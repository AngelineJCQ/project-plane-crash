# Plane Crash Project
 
 This is a place to hold scrollytelling project about all the plane crash accidents in China's history.

 ## Headline: China's civil aviation accident history: The last full plane crash with no survivors was 20 years ago.

 On March 26, Chinese authorities officially confirmed that there was no survivors in the crash of a China Eastern 737-800 earlier this week with 132 people on board. This tragedy is one of the total eight fatal civil aviation accidents since 2000 in China. The last crash with no single survivor can be dated back to 2004, with death toll of 53, when a plane stalled and crashed less than one minute after taking off from Baotou Airport.

 ## Current problem

 The narrative of interactive peice. I watched the video provided by Soma and I need a basemap to do the scrollytelling. I tried QGIS but it didn't work. So I just make a [demo](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V8wpC/1/) using datawrapper. Need some technical help on that!

 Also, dealing with GEOCODE is much HARDER than I thought!!! I can't believe it takes so long to clean up all the scraping data that I have! I guess I am still not so familiar with the Pandas... phew!
